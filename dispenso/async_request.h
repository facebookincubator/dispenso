 * A type for making async requests.  Although it is safe to use from multiple producers and
 * consumers, it is primarily intended to be used from single producer, single consumer.
 *
 * Typically the consumer will request an update of the value from thread 0, and the producer will
 * look whether an update was requested from thread 1.  Once the producer determines an update was
 * requested (updateRequested() returns true), it calls tryEmplaceUpdate() to update the underlying
 * data.  Then when the consumer on thread 0 next calls getUpdate(), an optional wrapper to the
 * updated data is returned, and the AsyncRequest object is reset (it no longer has valid data, and
 * no update will have yet been requested for the next update).
