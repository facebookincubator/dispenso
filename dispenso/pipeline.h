 * Pipeline work in stages.  Pipelines allow stages to specify parallelism limits by using the
 * <code>stage</code> function, or a function-like object can simply be passed directly, indicating
 * a serial stage.  Even if stages are serial, there can be parallelism between stages, so in a 3
 * stage serial pipeline, the expected runtime is the max of the 3 stages runtimes (note that this
 * is in the absence of pipeline overheads and with an infinitely long workstream.  In practice
 * speedup is somewhat less). This function will block until the entire pipeline has completed.
 *
 * @param pool The ThreadPool to run the work in.  This inherently determines the upper bound for
 * parallelism of the pipeline.
 * @param sIn The stages to run.  The first stage must be a Generator stage, the last must be a Sink
 * stage, and intermediate stages are Transform stages.
 * - If there is only one stage, it takes no
 * arguments, but returns a bool indicating completion (false means the pipeline is complete).
 * - Otherwise, the Generator stage takes no arguments and  must return an OpResult or std::optional
 * value, and an invalid/nullopt result indicates that the Generator is done (no more values
 * forthcoming).
 * - Transform stages should accept the output of the prior stage (or output.value() in the case of
 * OpResult or std::optional), and should return either a value or an OpResult or std::optional
 * value if the Transform is capable of filtering results. Invalid/nullopt OpResult or std::optional
 * values indicate that the value should be filtered, and not passed on to the next stage.
 * - The Sink stage should accept the output of the prior stage, just as a Transform stage does, but
 * does not return any value (or at least the pipeline will ignore it).
